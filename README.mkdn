# NAME

Data::Printer::Scoped - silence Data::Printer except in a controlled scope

# VERSION

version 0.001003

# SYNOPSIS

Sometimes you want to stick a dumper statement on a very hot codepath, but you
are interested in the output of your specific invocation. Often times this is
in the middle of a test. To narrow down when and what gets dumped, you can just
do this:

    use Data::Printer::Scoped qw/scope/;

    scope {
      do_something();
    };

    # elsewhere deep in another package
    sub some_hot_codepath {
      use Data::Printer;
      p $foo;
    }

# PROVIDED FUNCTIONS

- __scope(&)__

    Takes a single code block, and runs it. Before running, the overridden print
    method of Data::Printer will be enabled, and disabled afterward.
